        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <h2><b>Skills</b></h2>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs a passionate front-end developer, I am driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, constantly seeking to expand my skill set 
            and push the boundaries of creativity. The allure of emerging technologies has always captivated me, propelling me on an endless 
            journey of discovery and growth. In my pursuit of excellence, I view learning not as a destination but as a perpetual voyage, where 
            each day presents an opportunity for refinement and advancement.<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith a robust foundation in technologies such as React JS, Python, Oracle, and MySQL, I am steadfast in my commitment to honing my
             expertise in these domains. My passion for development parallels an upward trajectory on a graph, a testament to my unwavering 
             dedication and relentless pursuit of mastery. Each obstacle surmounted and every new proficiency attained serves to intensify my fervor, 
             embodying a resolute resolve to excel in both my personal and professional evolution within the realm of development.<br>
             &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeyond my technical pursuits, I am a fervent dancer, infusing my life with rhythm and expression. Additionally, my eloquence in
             both English and Tamil has facilitated my success as an orator, garnering accolades at various levels of competition. These refined 
             communication skills not only enhance my presentations but also instill a profound sense of confidence within me.<br>
             &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs a team leader, I embrace the challenges of leadership with aplomb, guiding my team with unwavering clarity and vision. It is 
             through these multifaceted endeavors that I continually strive for excellence, epitomizing a steadfast commitment to growth, innovation, 
             and leadership in all facets of my life.<br>
